# Restaurant 3D Object Dataset
###### [Hamidreza Kasaei](www.ai.rug.nl/hkasaei)
##

The Restaurant Object Dataset (RGB-D) contains 306 views of one instance of each category (Bottle, Bowl, Flask, Fork, Knife, Mug, Plate, Spoon, Teapot, and Vase), and 31 views of Unknown objects views (e.g. object views that belong to the furniture). These objects were extracted from 100 views of table-top scenes. All object views were hand annotated with the respective category labels.

The object views are named as follows:
<Category>_Object<number>.pcd - A 3D point cloud stored in PCD format (http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.php), readable with the Point Cloud Library (PCL).
